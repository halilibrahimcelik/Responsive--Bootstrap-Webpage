# Responsive--Bootsrap-Webpage

The purpose of the this project is to display a responsive one-page website.

In this project I mainly use Bootstrap components.

I fixed the navbar, so that you can have access to the menu whenever you want, 

For icons I used font-awesome library,

For displaying images on the courses section, I used third-package library Fslightbox.js
